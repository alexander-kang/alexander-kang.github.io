                        <h2>A web-based choreographing tool that simplifies the song, formation, and costume selection process</h2>
                        <h2>Details</h2>
                            <p>cor.io supports choreographers in their creative process by alleviating some of the stress of details like selecting music, formations, and costumes.</p>
                            <p>This way, choreographers are more free to focus on their creative vision for their dance piece.</p>
                        <h2>How it works</h2>
                            <p>After the user inputs a genre/vibe that they want their piece to embody, cor.io generates recommendations for song choices.</p>
                            <p>Then, given the user's selection of a song, cor.io generates a list of potential starting formations for the user to look through.</p>
                            <p>This way, the user has some control over the direction the formations will go in.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, every formation has an associated visualization in case it is unclear what cor.io is trying to portray.</p>
                            <p>After the user selects a starting formation, cor.io generates the full set of formations based on that feedback.</p>
                            <p>From there, the user is presented with some inspiration for a potential costume scheme for their piece.</p>
                            <p>There is also an associated image to help the user imagine what the outfit cor.io is describing could look like.</p>
                        <h2>How to get it</h2>
                            <p>As this was a group project and was originally designed for a class, I try to keep the source code private.</p>
                            <p>However, if you're really interested in seeing/playing with the code, feel free to send me an email.</p>
                            <p>Since I mentioned this was a group project, I should also mention that I did most of the implementation (all of the backend and some of the frontend).</p>
